Python
------

* Introduction:

-> Python is a programming language.
-> It is kind of interpreted language. (We don't have to compile the program to execute)
-> It is dynamic type language.(We don't have to specify the type of variables)
-> We can use python for scripting, web development and GUI programming.

* Getting Started:

-> We need to have python installed on our computer to getting started with python.
-> Go to www.python.org for downloading python.
-> Once download is complete, we can install it based on which operating system we are using. There are different
   options to install python on computer. Refer website for that.
-> Once python is installed on computer, we can use it from command prompt(Terminal).

** Dive Into Python :

-> To use python(at basic level) we need to open command prompt(compt).
-> After that write "python" in compt. You will see python command line interface their with python version and all.
-> This is simple command line interface for python language. Here you can type any python related code and execute.
   This command line interface ship with python binaries(setup). We don't need to do anything for setup this.
-> Let us create very small program "Hello World !".

-> print ("Hello World !")

-> Write above code into compt and press enter you will see "Hello World ! " printed on second line.
-> "print" is python inbuilt function that useful for printing something. It will take argument as anything you want to
   print on screen.
-> Function : Function is group of programming sentences. It is useful for reusability of code. Like here "print" is function
   that we can use multiple times. Function can take arguments or not.

** Basics:

-> Write following code into compt:

   a = 10
   b = 20
   c = a + b
   print (c)

-> Here we have lot of things to understand. Here a is variable that holds the value 10.
-> Variable : Variable is one type of container. In variable we can hold the value. Here we hold the 10 value into a variable
              Value of variable may change over the time. We can re-value the same variable.
-> In above snippet we have total of 3 variables that holds different values. Look at line number 3, here we add values of
   two variables and print that values on line number four. Execute this code we can have result 30 on screen.
